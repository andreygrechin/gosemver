- JSON output support

## Installation

### go install

```shell
go install github.com/andreygrechin/gosemver@latest
```

### Homebrew tap

You may also install the latest version of `gosemver` using the Homebrew tap:

## Usage

### Validate a Version

```shell
$ gosemver validate 1.2.3
valid

$ gosemver validate v1.2.3-beta.1+build.123
valid

$ gosemver validate 1.2
invalid # also returns exit code 1
```

### Compare Versions

Compare two versions, outputs:

- `-1` if the first version is lower
- `0` if equal
- `1` if the first version is higher

```shell
$ gosemver compare v1.0.0 v1.2.3
-1

$ gosemver compare 1.0.0 1.0.0-alpha
1
```

### Find Version Differences

Identify the most significant difference between versions:

```shell
$ gosemver diff v1.0.0 v1.1.0
minor
$ gosemver diff v1.0.0 v1.0.0-beta1
prerelease
```

### Get Version Identifiers

Extract specific version identifiers:

```shell
$ gosemver get major 1.2.3
1

$ gosemver get prerelease 1.2.3-beta.1
beta.1

$ gosemver get build 1.2.3+build.123
build.123

$ gosemver get release 1.2.3-beta.1+build.123
1.2.3

$ gosemver get json 1.2.3-beta.1+build.123
{"major":1,"minor":2,"patch":3,"prerelease":"beta.1","build":"build.123","release":"1.2.3"}
```

### Bump Version Identifiers

Increment version identifiers:

```shell
$ gosemver bump major 1.2.3
2.0.0
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

$ gosemver bump prerelease 1.2.3 --prerelease-id beta
1.2.3-beta

=======
$ gosemver bump prerelease 1.2.3 --prerelease-id beta
1.2.3-beta
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
$ gosemver bump release 1.2.3-beta.1
1.2.3
```
